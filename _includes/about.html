                    ADASTACK is a successful top performing pool since December 2019,<br>
                    through the ITN and currently Mainnet.<br><br>

                    We operate a SINGLE stake pool, by delegationg to ADASTACK you will
                    increase the decentralisation of Cardano.<br><br>

                    We care very much about Cardano, we are a member of<br>
                    Cardano Friends and Family,<br>
                    Cardano Social Council,<br>
                    Stake Pool Operator Collective Representation Assembly and<br>
                    Inter Stake Pool Peering Agreement.<br><br>

                    ADASTACK's infrastructure runs on bare metal setups to ensure<br>
                    best performace and capacity for the Cardano network<br><br>

                    A pledge of 1M+ ADA, is a show of commitment to the pool and the network.<br><br>

                    The pool passes 98% of block rewards to delegators and claims 2%<br>
                    with the minimum pool cost set.<br><br>
