                    ADASTACK is a successful top performing pool since December 2019,<br>
                    through the ITN and currently Mainnet.<br><br>

                    ADASTACK's infrastructure runs on bare metal setups to ensure<br>
                    best performance and capacity for the Cardano network<br><br>

                    A pledge of 1M+ ADA, is a show of commitment to the pool and the network.<br><br>

                    The pool passes 98% of block rewards to delegators and claims 2%<br><br>
                    
                    20% of the pool operator rewards are donated to the <a href="https://selfdriven.foundation">selfdriven foundation</a><br>
                    "be curious, be caring"<br><br>

                    We operate a SINGLE stake pool, by delegating to ADASTACK you will
                    increase the decentralisation and development of Cardano!<br><br>
